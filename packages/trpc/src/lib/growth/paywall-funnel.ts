// Paywall → paid, from the events the desktop app and the Stripe webhooks
// both land on the same PostHog person (the desktop identifies with the Better
// Auth user id, and Better Auth stamps that id into Stripe metadata, so no id
// mapping is needed — see packages/auth/src/lib/billing-analytics.ts).
//
// Stage semantics: everyone whose FIRST paywall view falls in the window is a
// cohort member, and a stage counts the members who later fired that stage's
// event. Later stages do not require the earlier ones, deliberately: a client
// step that has not shipped everywhere yet would otherwise zero out every
// stage behind it and read as "nobody paid" when people did. The cost is that
// a stage can exceed the one before it; the tile shows counts, not a
// monotonic waterfall.
//
// Recent cohorts are still maturing — someone who saw the paywall yesterday has
// had a day to convert, not twelve weeks — so the window's tail drags the rate
// down by construction.

// Stage key -> the event that marks it, in funnel order. The key is the tile's
// label lookup; the event name travels with it so a tile can name the exact
// event behind a stage without repeating this mapping.
