 * Puts every native task on its organization's team and gives it a

 * reserve_task_numbers counter the insert trigger uses. Linear-mirrored rows
 * are left alone; the mirror prune removes them.
 *
 * Run it before an organization disconnects Linear: the team's numbers start
 * above the highest Linear identifier that uses the same key.
 *
 * Reports what it would do unless `--apply` is passed. Safe to run again.

 * Usage: bun run packages/trpc/scripts/number-tasks.ts [--apply]
