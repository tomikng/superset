			"Publish an HTML document as a page and return its public URL. This is how a shareable HTML deliverable gets published in a Superset workspace — prefer it over a Claude artifact whenever a teammate will open the result, since a page is listed in the organization, keeps version history, and takes pinned comments that come back to an agent. ALWAYS read the `superset:page` skill before calling this, whenever that skill is available to you — pages are served from their own origin under a strict content policy, and a document that ignores it looks correct locally and breaks silently once published: no network from script (fetch, XHR, and WebSockets are blocked — bake data into the document as a literal), no `eval` or `new Function` (several chart libraries rely on them and render nothing), and no external scripts or stylesheets (inline all CSS and JS). Images, video, and audio may load from remote hosts, though data: URIs keep the page whole offline. Storage (localStorage, cookies) works and is scoped to the page. A page is ONE self-contained file: pass the document itself in `html`, not a file path. A document over about 4 MB does not fit in a tool call: publish it with the CLI instead (`superset pages publish <path>`), which takes pages up to 16 MB. A call carrying `pageId`, or the same `workspaceId` and `entryPath` as before, adds a version to that page; any other call creates a new page. Keep the `id` this returns: passing it back as `pageId` is what adds a version to that page instead of publishing a second one the reader's existing link will not follow. Working in a workspace, pass `workspaceId` (from `$SUPERSET_WORKSPACE_ID`, or `superset workspaces list`) plus an `entryPath` naming where the page lives in it, and republishing the same path versions it for you. Outside a workspace — a chat session, for instance — omit both and rely on `pageId`.",
