# Cloud sandboxes: what to settle before this leaves the team

**Tickets live in the Linear "Sandboxes" project** (https://linear.app/superset-sh/project/sandboxes-a52055bc936e). This file is the reasoning — what a sandbox is and why it differs from a machine someone owns — and stays the thing to read before changing this code. When you find something new, write it here and file the ticket there; when an item is fixed, say so here rather than deleting it, so the next person can see the shape of the trap.

Companion to `cloud-sandbox-mismatches.md`. That file is about where a sandbox
doesn't behave like a machine someone owns; this one is about what we still owe
before people outside the team can create one.

Today the feature is gated two ways: a PostHog flag, and an `@superset.sh`
check in the API. Several things below are fine *only* because of that second
gate — they are marked **gated**, and every one of them becomes blocking the
moment a non-internal user can create a sandbox. Treat removing the gate as the
event that promotes them all.

## Money

**A sandbox bills from provision, not from ready.** Everything after that call —
resolving the repo, cloning, booting host-service — can fail with a sandbox
already running. Create now tears the sandbox down on failure and keeps the
`failed` row as the record; before that fix, one session left ten failed
provisions running indefinitely, and nothing in the product would ever have
shown them.

**An idle sandbox stops after its session timeout. Done, with a caveat.** A
session ends four hours after its last extension; only the workspace someone
has open extends it (every token refresh with `wake`), so a closed workspace
stops within four hours and costs snapshot storage only. Still owed: a per-org
quota and cost visibility in the product — and a decision on unattended agent
runs, which die with the session (Blaxel froze processes; Vercel snapshots the
filesystem and boots fresh).

**Delete deletes.** `useDestroyWorkspace` decides by the cloud row, not by the
host it happens to reach: a cloud workspace goes to `cloudWorkspace.delete`,
which removes the sandbox (and its snapshots) at the provider and marks the row
deleted; only a machine someone owns gets the host-side destroy. Verified
2026-09-11: four deletes from the sidebar, four sandboxes gone at Vercel. Left
over: a pane still open on the deleted workspace keeps asking
`cloudWorkspace.access` and logs "Cloud workspace is deleted" until it is
closed.

## Credentials and blast radius

**Model credentials are ours by default. gated** A sandbox without a personal
sign-in (Settings › Cloud › Agents, per user, `agent_credentials`) runs on the
org's Anthropic and OpenAI keys, brokered at the firewall, so agent usage lands
on our bill with no per-org attribution or cap. Fine while only we can create
sandboxes; unshippable after. Rotation no longer needs a recreate: the
firewall policy is live-updatable and every wake and `access` keepalive
re-derives and re-applies it, so a rotated key reaches a running box within
one keepalive.

**The GitHub token outlives the clone. Fixed (v2 layout, 2026-09-13).**
`git clone` with the token in the URL wrote it into `.git/config`, so a
repo-scoped installation token sat in the working tree for anything in the
sandbox to read — including an agent that followed a prompt injection. The
token is now a firewall header rule like the model keys (`Basic` for
`github.com`, `Bearer` for `api.github.com` and `uploads.github.com`), the
clone URL carries nothing, and the box holds only a `GH_TOKEN` placeholder so
`gh` is willing to call. The rule is re-minted on every wake and every
`access` keepalive, so a rule's token is never older than one keepalive.

**A visitor acts on GitHub as the workspace's creator. Accepted (multiplayer).**
Any member of the organization can open any cloud workspace; that is the
default on purpose. The GitHub rule carries the creator's own connection
(Settings › Connections) when they have one, so a member who opens someone
else's workspace commits, pushes and opens pull requests as that person, and
reaches every repository the creator can reach through the App, including ones
the visitor cannot. Before cloud workspaces leave the team this needs an
answer: per-member identity inside a shared box, or a workspace falling back
to the installation token while someone other than its creator holds a ticket.

**A sandbox has exactly one gate, and it is ours.** A sandbox's own port is
a public URL that clients never see; they reach a workspace through the
sandbox gate (`apps/gate`), which verifies a ticket the API signed
for that person's session and forwards with a bearer only it and the API can
derive. host-service behind it accepts that bearer and nothing else. Nothing
in the box holds the shared secret, a ticket for one workspace fails every
other, and a sandbox booted without its secret answers nobody. What remains
is a leaked unexpired ticket — hours of terminals, git and the filesystem for
one workspace, through the gate only.

What makes that worth more than the sandbox itself: code execution inside gets
the customer's repo, the write-scoped GitHub token in `.git/config` above, and
the ability to *spend* our model keys through the egress proxy. The proxy stops
an attacker reading those keys; it does not stop them using them.

Three things to settle before the gate comes off, none of them needed while it
is only us:

- **Get the ticket out of the query string.** A browser can't set headers on a
  WebSocket upgrade, so the ticket rides as `token` in the socket URL, where it
  reaches logs and proxies far more readily than a header would. The gate owns
  the upgrade now, so `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` (a header a browser can set) or
  single-use socket tickets are both available.
- **Narrow CORS.** The gate answers `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. It grants
  no ambient authority (the ticket is not a cookie), but it does make a leaked
  ticket usable from any origin. Pin it to the app's origins once they are
  enumerable.
- **Secret rotation.** `SANDBOX_GATE_SECRET` signs every ticket and derives
  every sandbox's host secret; rotating it invalidates every running sandbox's
  bearer at once, so a rotation is a re-provision. Accepting two secrets at
  the gate during a window is the usual shape.

## A saturated sandbox looks like a dead one

An image workspace ran 4 vCPU / 8 GB (now 8 / 16 GB, the plan's cap). An agent that brings up the dev stack
(Postgres, the API, Vite, an Electron instance) exhausts that, and the VM stops
answering anything: `vercel sandbox exec` hangs, the public URL answers without
CORS headers, and the app shows "Connecting… / Unknown host" with a hint about a
tray menu Linux does not have. Seen 2026-09-11 from a throwaway prompt that
invited the agent to "try the new image". Recovery is a platform-side
`vercel sandbox stop` (snapshots the disk, kills everything) followed by the
app's Retry, which wakes a clean session. Still owed: memory pressure shown in
the product, and a kill switch for the runaway process short of stopping the
box. **Open.**

## Untested behaviour

These are unknowns, not known failures — but each could change the design, and
none is expensive to answer.

**Sleep and wake. Answered.** A stopped session resumes on the open
workspace's next token mint (`wake`), and host-service is started again as
part of it — a resumed session has no processes. Nothing restarts host-service
if it dies mid-session; the token keeps minting either way, so the app can
still believe a dead sandbox is reachable until the health poll says otherwise.

**Disk durability. Answered.** The filesystem is snapshotted on every stop and
restored on resume (measured: a file written before `stop()` is there after,
resume plus first command in about two seconds). Snapshots expire 30 days
after last use; a workspace untouched for longer than that is gone.

**Token refresh across a backgrounded app.** Access is re-minted at 80% of a
10-minute life. An app asleep past expiry should recover on the next tick;
untested.

## Workflow

**Getting changes out is unverified.** Push and PR creation from a sandbox
haven't been exercised end to end. Without them the feature is a demo — this is
the first thing to prove, ahead of any polish.

**No fleet view.** Nothing in the product lists running sandboxes, their cost,
or lets you stop one. Today that lives in the provider console.

**Nothing reaps a row stuck in `provisioning`. Open.** A create that dies
between inserting the row and reporting the sandbox leaves a `cloud_workspaces`
row in `provisioning` forever: the sidebar shows a workspace that cannot open,
`access` refuses it because the status isn't `ready`, and no code path ever looks
at it again. It happened for real — a production create hit the API function's
60s limit mid-bootstrap, and the row outlived the sandbox it named. Provisioning
is ~5s now, so the window is small rather than gone; a killed function, a
provider timeout or a crash still lands there. Wanted: a sweep that fails rows
older than a few minutes and tears down any sandbox they name, plus the same
teardown on the paths that can't currently reach it. One row from that incident
had to be cleared by hand.

**The Superset CLI is offered but not installed. Open.** A cloud workspace's
agent row includes "Superset CLI" alongside Claude, Codex and Copilot, and
picking it fails with command-not-found: the image installs the agent CLIs but
not ours. It also matters beyond the picker — the CLI is how an agent spawns
workspaces and other agents, so a sandbox without it can't orchestrate. Install
it in the image, or hide the option for cloud workspaces until it is there.

**Creating doesn't open the workspace. Open.** Submit returns, the row appears
in the sidebar, and the user has to click it. Every other creation path lands
you in the thing you just made.

**Submit shows a pending state rather than a toast. Done.** Creation used to
report progress through a toast ("Creating cloud workspace…" → "Cloud workspace
created"), which put the state of a thing you were waiting on in a corner,
detached from the button you pressed. The submit control now carries it —
spinner, disabled in flight — and only failures toast. Kept here as the
reasoning, since the same argument applies to any other await we add to this
flow.

## Model

**A cloud workspace is tied to a `v2_projects` row, and that table is already
retired. Open.** #6436 decoupled the app from cloud `v2_projects` and dropped
the FKs that pointed at it "ahead of the table's removal"; nothing writes a row
there any more. Three days later `cloud_workspaces.project_id` landed as a
cascade FK into it, and `create` / provisioning resolve the repo to clone from
that row. So only projects that still have a legacy row can get a cloud
workspace, the desktop picker offers projects the API then rejects, and
dropping the table would cascade-delete every cloud workspace. The mobile port
lists the rows that resolve to a repo through an interim
`cloudWorkspace.listProjects`, fenced as such.

The row was never the point — provisioning only ever wanted a repo to clone, a
credential to fetch it with, and a display name. What it should hang off is an
**environment**: an org-scoped definition of what a sandbox contains — repos
(0..n, one primary), setup commands, env var names, base image/version, and
later a provider snapshot per version (SUPER-1892). `cloud_workspaces` then
references the environment plus the primary repo's branch. Keep v1 of that
entity to exactly one primary GitHub repo, enforced by validation rather than
schema: host-service assumes one workspace is one git root, and multi-repo or
no-repo sandboxes push into every git-shaped feature (status, diff, PRs,
files-changed) before they can degrade gracefully.

**Clients must not orchestrate a create.** Creating a cloud workspace is one
API call; the sandbox does the rest on boot (self-seed, fetch, start). Two
follow-ups fall out of holding that line rather than compensating in the app:
the sandbox should launch the agent from the typed prompt itself (today the
prompt only feeds the auto-name and nothing runs it — desktop and mobile both
open to an empty workspace), and attachments for a sandbox belong in blob
storage rather than written to the host, so a create can carry them before the
sandbox exists. Neither should be done by having a client wait for `ready` and
call `agents.run`.

## Provider

**Everything is scoped to one Vercel project.** Sandboxes, their snapshots and
the image repository live in the team's `sandboxes` project, reached with a
token that is not the deploy token. A second region is a per-sandbox
`region` choice, not a second project.

**Region is one setting for everyone.** `VERCEL_SANDBOX_REGION` (sfo1) is
where image-created sandboxes and released goldens live, and forks inherit the
golden's region. Snapshots are region-bound — a golden in iad1 cannot be
forked into sfo1, and failover regions do not replicate it — so routing each
user to the nearest region means a golden per region and a region column on
the environment. Worth it: a request to a sandbox in sfo1 answers in ~23 ms
from San Francisco against ~190 ms to iad1, and the desktop pane pays that on
every frame.

**The sandbox domain is the only ingress.** No relay hop, which is why
WebSockets work and there is no relay on the critical path — but it also means
the desktop talks straight to `*.vercel.run`, and that domain is in the
renderer's CSP. Moving this behind the relay later removes that CSP entry, the
CORS wildcard, and the public URL altogether; it is the stronger posture, at
the cost of a hop on every keystroke.
