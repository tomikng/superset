# Cloud sandboxes: acceptance suite (Vercel port)

The checks a change to the sandbox stack has to pass before it ships. Written
for the Blaxel → Vercel port and kept because every one of these is a place
the stack broke before. Each entry names the thing under test, how to run it,
and what "pass" looks like. Mark results inline while running.

Section 11 is the v2 layout (2026-09-13: `packages/sandbox`, the bundle, the
`ubuntu` user, the boot runner, the env push, header rules for every
credential, websockify on its own port). Where an earlier entry names a path
or mechanism v2 replaced, section 11 says what the check is now.

Status legend: `[ ]` not run · `[x]` pass · `[!]` fail (note why).

## 1. Provider primitives (SDK, no Superset code)

Run from a throwaway script against the `sandboxes` project in the
`superset-sh` team. These are the facts the design rests on.

- [x] **1.1 WebSocket through `sandbox.domain(port)`** — a `ws` echo server on
  the exposed port answers a browser-style upgrade with a query string.
  Pass: message round-trips. (Measured 2026-09-10: yes.)
- [x] **1.2 `Sandbox.get` on a stopped sandbox does not resume it** — returns
  the domain in <1s with status `stopped`. Pass: no session starts.
- [x] **1.3 Resume latency** — first command after `stop()` completes in <5s.
  (Measured: 2.3s.)
- [x] **1.4 Filesystem survives stop, processes do not** — a file written before
  `stop()` is present after; a detached server is gone. Pass: both true.
- [x] **1.5 Firewall header injection** — `networkPolicy.allow[domain].transform`
  sets a header on egress to that domain; `"*": []` keeps the rest of the
  internet reachable. Pass: httpbin echoes the header, example.com 200.
- [x] **1.6 Fork carries files and takes env overrides** — fork of a stopped
  sandbox has the source's files and the overridden variable values.

## 2. Image

- [x] **2.1 Image builds and pushes to VCR** — `bun run --cwd packages/sandbox image`
  builds `linux/amd64` and pushes `superset-hostsvc:<tag>`; VCR reports `Ready`. (~10 min incl. VCR Preparing)
- [x] **2.2 Natives load** — in a sandbox from the image: `node -e
  'require("/app/node_modules/better-sqlite3"); require("/app/node_modules/node-pty")'`
  exits 0. No compile step ran (no build-essential in the image). (gate probe, 2026-09-12)
- [x] **2.3 host-service serves** — `/app/start.sh` run through `runCommand`
  (detached) brings `/trpc/health.check` to 200 via `sandbox.domain(4879)`
  within 30s. Confirms the platform runs no ENTRYPOINT, honours `WORKDIR`, and
  that `PORT` is not injected against us. (gate probe: 200)
- [x] **2.4 Runs as root with the baked Claude config** — `id -u` is 0 and
  `/root/.claude.json` has `bypassPermissionsModeAccepted`. (gate probe, 2026-09-12)
- [x] **2.5 Firewall CA reaches the terminal** — inside a PTY opened through
  host-service, `curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/models` with the placeholder
  key returns an Anthropic response (not a TLS error) when a transform rule is
  set. Proves the per-sandbox CA env passes the sandbox-mode terminal env gate. (brokered call from the sandbox 200 with the CA env present)

## 3. Ingress authentication (the gate Blaxel used to provide)

- [x] **3.1 No token → 401** — `GET <domain>/events` with no `Authorization`
  header is refused by host-service (not by an edge); `/trpc/health.check` is
  public by design. (gate probe, 2026-09-12)
- [x] **3.2 Wrong workspace → 401** — a token minted for workspace A is refused
  by workspace B's host-service (audience check). (gate probe, 2026-09-12)
- [x] **3.3 Expired token → 401** — a token past `exp` is refused. (same verifier; exp checked in verifySandboxAccessToken)
- [x] **3.4 Forged token → 401** — a token signed with another key is refused. (gate probe, 2026-09-12)
- [x] **3.5 Valid token → 200** on HTTP, and the WebSocket routes (`/events`,
  `/terminal/*`, `/desktop/vnc`) accept it as the `token` query param. (gate probe + desktop)
- [x] **3.6 The sandbox cannot mint** — the sandbox env holds only the public
  key (`grep SIGNING /proc/1/environ` finds nothing private).

## 4. Provisioning through the API

Dev API (`bun dev`), Neon dev branch, real Vercel project.

- [x] **4.1 Image workspace** — `cloudWorkspace.create` on the `Default`
  environment reaches `ready`; `sandbox_url` is a `vercel.run` domain;
  `provider` is `vercel`. (UI create → ready in 14s)
- [x] **4.2 Fork workspace** — create on the internal environment (fork of the
  golden) reaches `ready` and `test -d /workspace/node_modules` passes inside. (UI create → ready in 6s)
- [x] **4.3 Branch checkout** — `git -C /workspace rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
  is the requested branch for both source kinds. (agent printed main)
- [x] **4.4 Provision failure tears down** — a create against a nonexistent
  image ends `failed` and no sandbox with that name exists on Vercel. (decrypt failure on a copied prod row failed the row and tore the sandbox down)
- [x] **4.5 Delete deletes** — `cloudWorkspace.delete` removes the Vercel
  sandbox (`Sandbox.get` → not found) and marks the row `deleted`. (row
  `deleted`, `Sandbox.get` 404)
- [x] **4.6 Naming** — a create with a prompt and no name gets a generated name
  before `ready`. ("Git Branch & CPU Cores")

## 5. Desktop, end to end (the real app)

`bun dev` desktop against the dev API, signed in as an `@superset.sh` account.

- [x] **5.1 Create from the UI** — New workspace → Cloud → environment →
  create; the provisioning screen resolves into an open workspace.
- [x] **5.2 Terminal** — a terminal pane opens, `echo hi` echoes, resize works. (follow-up prompt answered with df output)
- [x] **5.3 Files and git** — the file tree lists `/workspace`, the Changes tab
  shows a status (not "No changes" on error). (tree + Changes)
- [x] **5.4 Desktop pane** — the VNC pane connects (`RFB` handshake), shows the
  Xfce session with the Plank dock and a wallpaper, is view-only until "Take
  control", and on a fork with variables the dev stack and Electron desktop
  come up on it. (Skin check / ws-9cdd…: Xvnc, Arc-Dark, dock with one Chrome
  icon, hover label, 9 Electron processes, wallpaper per box)
- [x] **5.5 Sidebar polling does not wake sandboxes** — with a cloud workspace
  closed for >2 min, `Sandbox.list` shows it `stopped`/not resumed while the
  sidebar stays open. (`access` without `wake` must not resume.) (2 min stopped with the sidebar open)
- [x] **5.6 Reopen wakes** — opening a stopped workspace from the sidebar
  resumes it and the terminal comes back within ~10s. (agent pane resumed ~20–30s after opening)
- [x] **5.7 Token refresh** — leave a workspace open >10 min; terminals keep
  working across the token re-mint (no 401 in the network log). (no 401 in the renderer console over 35 min of refreshes)
- [x] **5.8 Built-in agent launch** — create with the Claude agent and a
  prompt; Claude answers in the adopted pane. (Branch: main / nproc: 4)
- [x] **5.9 Delete from the UI** removes the row and the sandbox. (sidebar
  context menu → Delete → confirm)

## 6. Environments (golden and fork)

- [x] **6.1 Promote** — Environments → promote a ready workspace; a golden
  sandbox `env-<id>` exists on Vercel, stopped, with a current snapshot, and no
  identity files (`/data/host.db`, `/data/.workspace-bootstrapped`) or identity
  env (workspace id, git token, agent credentials). (via the real API; source resumed after)
- [x] **6.2 Fork from the promoted environment** — a workspace created on it
  has the promoter's installed files and its own identity. (claude 2.1.267 —
  the promoter's auto-update, image ships 2.1.257 — own workspace id, no
  promoter env)
- [x] **6.3 Environment variables reach a fork** — the environment's variables
  (delivered as `/data/environment.env`, since the sandbox env is capped at
  4 KB) are in host-service's process env and materialize `/workspace/.env`
  for the dev stack; the PTY allowlist is unchanged. (117-line `.env` with the
  multi-line PEM intact; in-sandbox API `get-session` → 200)
- [x] **6.4 Release pipeline** — `bun run sandbox:release` builds the image,
  creates the golden, runs `internal-setup.sh`, probes a fork, writes the
  `environments` rows (`provider = vercel`). (93s end to end)
- [ ] **6.5 Two forks of one golden are independent** — files written in one
  are absent in the other. (not run)

## 7. Lifecycle and cost

- [x] **7.1 Idle stop** — a workspace nobody has open stops on its own within
  the session timeout, and its snapshot storage is bounded
  (`keepLastSnapshots.count = 1`). (by configuration: timeout 4h, expiresAt = start + 4h; not waited out)
- [ ] **7.2 Active extend** — a workspace held open past the timeout keeps
  running (the access refresh extends the session). (not exercised: the
  extension only fires with under an hour left and `update({timeout})` does not
  move a running session's expiry, so this needs a 3h wait; code path reviewed)
- [x] **7.3 Resume restarts host-service** — after a stop, the next wake runs
  `/app/start.sh` again and the workspace serves (bootstrapped marker means no
  re-clone). (host-service + pty-daemon fresh after wake)
- [x] **7.4 Nothing leaks** — after the suite, `Sandbox.list` for the project
  shows only the goldens and whatever is deliberately kept. (only
  `env-internal-mtvzcbhx` left)

## 8. Credentials

- [x] **8.1 Organization keys are brokered** — with no personal sign-in, the
  PTY env holds the placeholder for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and a request from
  the sandbox to `api.anthropic.com` succeeds (header injected at the
  firewall). Same for OpenAI. Applies to forks too (the Blaxel limitation is
  gone). (placeholder in env, models 200)
- [x] **8.2 Personal sign-in wins** — with a credential saved in Settings ›
  Cloud › Agents (PR #7391), the PTY env holds that value
  (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or a real `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and no brokering
  rule is set for that provider, so the personal credential is what reaches
  the API. (real key in host-service and claude env; policy brokers openai only)
- [x] **8.3 Golden carries no credential** — after promote, the golden's env
  has none of `AGENT_CREDENTIAL_ENV_NAMES`. (golden policy allow-all, env empty)
- [ ] **8.4 Git clone token** — private-repo clone succeeds via the askpass
  path; the token is not in `.git/config`. (not run: local dev has no GitHub App key, the clone was public)

## 9. Mobile

- [x] **9.1 Typecheck** — `apps/mobile` typechecks with the renamed token
  plumbing. (only the pre-existing unref errors)
- [ ] **9.2 Simulator terminal** (optional, needs an internal account) — a
  cloud workspace terminal connects through the WebView with the new token
  query param. (not run: no simulator pass in this session)

## 10. Regression gate

- [x] **10.1** `bun run lint:fix` clean. (`bun run lint` clean)
- [x] **10.2** `typecheck` clean for trpc, host-service, desktop, mobile, shared. (mobile: only the pre-existing `unref` errors)
- [x] **10.3** `bun test` in `packages/trpc`, `packages/host-service`,
  `packages/shared` — no new failures versus main. (shared 1012 pass; trpc
  246 pass, 4 pre-existing `sitemap.test.ts` env failures; host-service 1712
  pass, 1 pre-existing daemon integration timeout untouched by this change)
- [x] **10.4** `bun run check:i18n` clean (new server errors translated). (two Blaxel messages removed, nothing added)
- [x] **10.5** `docs/cloud-sandbox-mismatches.md` and
  `docs/cloud-sandbox-considerations.md` updated: Blaxel-specific entries marked
  fixed or replaced, new Vercel entries added.
- [x] **10.6** No `blaxel` left in code: `git grep -il blaxel` matches only
  `packages/db/drizzle/` and the docs and plans that record the migration.

## 11. The v2 layout (2026-09-13)

Automated, on every PR that touches the sandbox (`.github/workflows/sandbox.yml`):

- [x] **11.1 Boot twice** — `bun run --cwd packages/sandbox image --local`
  then `bun run src/boot-twice.ts`: the image boots as a box would (stub
  `sandbox.conf`, `superset-boot` with the secret in its env), host-service
  answers on 4879 as `ubuntu` with pid, ready flags and `ptyd.sock` in
  `/run/superset`, refuses `/events` without the secret, the display comes up
  (X, websockify on 6080, window manager), no secret is on disk, every step
  reports current; the second boot clears the run dir, installs nothing,
  fetches nothing, skips every step, keeps the checkout. (2026-09-14: 20/20,
  host-service ready in 4.4 s on both boots)
- [x] **11.2 Manifest math** — `bun test` in `packages/sandbox`: step versions
  move when and only when the script, a declared asset, an upstream step or
  the salt changes; the tarball is deterministic. (9 pass)
- [x] **11.3 Publish guard** — `bun run build --publish` refuses a bundle
  whose assets the bucket lacks; a second run uploads nothing. (bucket
  `superset-cdn`, `cdn.superset.sh/sandbox/<sha><suffix>`)

On demand (`workflow_dispatch` → `bun run src/real-sandbox.ts`, or the
release's probe):

- [x] **11.4 A real box** — provisioned from the registry image on this
  checkout's bundle, woken through `wakeSandbox`: health 200, `/events` 401,
  boot.log on the pinned bundle with no failed step, host-service as `ubuntu`
  with no brokered credential in its `/proc/<pid>/environ`, checkout on the
  branch, Xvnc + xfce4-session + plank up, an `RFB` handshake over
  `wss://<domain 6080>/websockify`, the gate admitting a ticket and refusing
  a forged one; then stop + wake: run dir cleared, nothing installed or
  fetched, every step skipped, checkout kept. (2026-09-14 on the dev project: all checks, wake in 11.9 s)
- [x] **11.5 Desktop pane through the gate** — the pane connects to the
  desktop port's gate address with its own ticket (`access` returns
  `desktop.url` + `desktop.token`); a screenshot of the Xfce session in the
  pane. (2026-09-14 in the dev app through the local gate: Xfce + dock, take control both ways, terminal from the dock, a 3.2 s window drag repainted 121 frames with an 18 ms median gap)
- [ ] **11.6 Release** — `bun run sandbox:release` against dev: runtime asset
  rewritten, bundle published, golden built with the internal `setup` hook,
  probe fork passes 11.4 plus the dev stack from the `start` hook, rows
  written only after; a failed probe leaves the previous rows intact.
- [ ] **11.7 Rollback** — point `environments.bundle_sha` at the previous sha
  (`environment.update`); the next wake flips `current` with no download.

Superseded by v2 (kept for the shape of the trap): 2.2–2.5 (`/app`, root,
`start.sh` → the bundle's runtime under `/opt/superset/host`, `ubuntu`,
`superset-boot`), 3.5 (`/desktop/vnc` → `/websockify` on the desktop port),
6.1 and 6.3 (`/data/*` and `/data/environment.env` → `/etc/superset`,
`/var/lib/superset` and the env push), 7.3 (`start.sh` → `superset-boot`),
8.4 (the askpass path → a header rule; no token in the box).
