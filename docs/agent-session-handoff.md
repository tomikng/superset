# Agent session handoff

"Continue with another agent" (terminal pane header, fork icon) starts a fresh agent seeded with
the source terminal's conversation. "Fork session" is different: it asks the source harness for a
native fork (`claude --resume <id> --fork-session`) and never reads a transcript.

## Where the transcript comes from

`transcriptSession` in `packages/host-service/src/terminal/terminal.ts` tries each source in turn:

| Order | Source | Used when | Quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Harness store (`readHarnessTranscript`) | Claude or Codex, while its session is still bound to the terminal | Every user and assistant turn, no tool output |
| 2 | PTY stream replay | Every other agent, or no session file found | Whatever the 2 MB output ring still holds. A Claude TUI fills it in well under a minute |
| 3 | Visible screen | Nothing retained | One screen |

The result is capped at `TERMINAL_HANDOFF_MAX_CHARS` (36,000, taken from Orca) and marked
`[earlier output omitted]` when it was cut. Raising it has a ceiling: an argv-transport agent gets
the prompt as one shell argument, and Linux limits one argument to 128 KB.

When a handoff arrives with only the last few seconds of context, the harness store missed and
the stream fallback answered.

## Code layout

| File (under `packages/host-service/src/terminal-agents/`) | Owns |
|---|---|
| `harness-sessions/transcript.ts` | `HARNESS_SESSION_FILES`, the lookup order, the reported-path check, `readHarnessTranscript`. Runs on a host worker (`workers/tasks/harness.ts`), so it and everything it imports stay free of native modules; a test walks its import graph |
| `harness-sessions/read-off-loop.ts` | `readHarnessTranscriptOffLoop`: what callers use. A failure answers null, so the handoff falls back to the terminal stream |
| `harness-sessions/index.ts` | `HARNESS_SESSION_STORES` and `hasHarnessSession`, for resume and fork, on the event loop (OpenCode's is SQLite) |
| `harness-sessions/<harness>.ts` | Per harness: `HarnessSessionFiles` (where its files are, how to parse them) and `HarnessSessionStore` (does it still keep a session) |
| `harness-sessions/tail.ts` | The bounded, widening read of a session file |
| `harness-session-ref.ts` | `terminalHarnessSession`: a terminal's binding, worktree, reported path and launch env as one `HarnessSessionRef` |
| `agent-config.ts` | `resolveHostAgentConfig` and `agentLaunchEnv`, the account env an agent launches under. The launch and every session lookup use it |
| `transcript-path.ts` | `isTrustedTranscriptPath`, shared with the subagent roster |

The handoff (`transcriptSession`), the CLI's `agents read`, and resume all build their ref with
`terminalHarnessSession`, so they agree on which account's store to read. Fork preflight has no
source terminal and builds its ref from the chosen agent config with the same `agentLaunchEnv`.
The harness comes from the binding, not the config's preset: a custom agent wrapping `claude` has
preset `custom`, but Claude wrote its session.

The subagent pane keeps its own parsers in `subagent-harnesses/`. They clip each entry for
display, which a handoff must not do.

## Finding a session file

The lookup order lives in `readHarnessTranscript` and is the same for every file-backed harness. For
Claude, which keeps one JSONL per session under `<CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR or ~/.claude>/projects/<dir>/`,
it goes:

1. **The path Claude reported.** Every Claude hook payload carries `transcript_path`. The notify
   hook (v20+) forwards it, and the host stores it on `terminal_agent_bindings.transcript_path`.
   This depends on nothing about Claude's layout, not even on the file being named after the
   session id (Orca has seen Claude versions where it is not).
2. **The path the harness's layout gives** (`files.locate`). For Claude: Claude Code 2.1.282 names the directory after the
   working directory, resolved through symlinks, NFC-normalized and without trailing separators, with every non-alphanumeric
   UTF-16 unit replaced by `-`. Past 200 characters it truncates and appends
   `Math.abs(javaHash(path)).toString(36)`. `claudeProjectDirName` copies this. It is not a
   documented contract.
3. **A search by session id**, also in `files.locate`. Claude's session ids are UUIDs, so `projects/*/<id>.jsonl` is the session
   wherever it was filed. This catches agents started in a subdirectory,
   `CLAUDE_CODE_PROJECT_DIR_NAME`, and future naming changes. The scan stops at 5,000 project
   directories.

Steps 2 and 3 look in the launch env's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` first, then in the default
`~/.claude`: a session started before the default account switched keeps writing where it began.

A miss on all three logs `[harness-sessions] no transcript for claude session …`, and a hit on
2 or 3 logs `found without a reported path`. If the first of those starts appearing in host logs, Claude
has changed its store.

## Trust and staleness

- The hook endpoint is unauthenticated, so a reported path is stored only if
  `isTrustedTranscriptPath` accepts it: absolute, `.jsonl`, and under the user's home. A
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` outside home is never stored, and falls through to steps 2 and 3.
- It is stored only while the binding still names the reporting session, and cleared when the
  binding moves to another session, so a later session never reads an earlier one's file.
- When read, it is checked again with `isTrustedTranscriptPath`, and its first megabyte must
  contain the session id (every Claude line and Codex's opening `session_meta` carry it). A caller
  of the unauthenticated hook therefore cannot point a handoff at some other transcript.
- A lookup that throws (an unreadable store) is logged and answers nothing, so the handoff falls
  back to the terminal stream instead of failing.
- Reading widens from the last 4 MB until the conversation fills the budget or the file ends,
  stopping at 128 MB, and reads each byte once. Most of a session file is tool output and
  screenshots, so a fixed tail dropped early turns that would have fit. All reads use one file
  descriptor, and a short read stops widening, so a file rewritten mid-read cannot splice lines.

## Compatibility

| Combination | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Old hook (≤ v19), new host | No `transcriptPath` arrives. Lookup starts at step 2 |
| New hook, old host | zod strips the unknown `transcriptPath` field. Nothing changes |
| Bindings created before migration `0036` | `transcript_path` is null until the next hook event from that session |
| Resume and fork preflight (`hasHarnessSession`) | Steps 2 and 3 only, and only under the env the relaunch will use: no reported path and no default-store fallback, since the relaunch would not look there either. Found is `true`. `false` needs a complete scan and the encoded project directory to exist without the file. Otherwise `null` (unknown, allowed) |

## Adding a harness

Write `harness-sessions/<harness>.ts` and register what it exports: its `HarnessSessionFiles` in
`HARNESS_SESSION_FILES` (worker-safe imports only) and its `HarnessSessionStore` in
`HARNESS_SESSION_STORES`:

- `files.locate`, for a store that keeps one file per session: find it under `env`. The
  reported path and the lookup order then come for free.
- `files.parseTurns`, to make handoffs read the conversation instead of the terminal stream. It
  gets a chunk that may start mid-line and must skip what it cannot parse.
- `hasSession`, for resume and fork. Return `null` unless absence is certain, because `false`
  refuses a fork.

If the harness's hook payload carries `transcript_path`, the notify hook already forwards it.

### Codex

Codex's hooks send `session_id` (the rollout id) and `transcript_path` like Claude's. Without a
reported path, `files.locate` walks `<CODEX_HOME or ~/.codex>/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/` newest first
for `rollout-<timestamp>-<id>.jsonl`, then the default `~/.codex`, stopping at 2,000 directories.
Reverting a thread writes another rollout for the same id as `…-<id>_<rollout id>.jsonl`; the
newest file wins. Codex 0.156 also carries a rollout-format migration, so the reported path is the
dependable route if the layout changes again.
`parseTurns` reads `message` items, wrapped in `response_item` or bare as in 2025 rollouts, and
skips the setup Codex sends as user messages: the rendered AGENTS.md, `<environment_context>`,
`<recommended_plugins>`, `<skill>` and `<user_instructions>`.

## Not covered

- Only Claude and Codex have `parseTurns`. OpenCode, pi and the rest hand off from the PTY stream.
- A compressed Codex rollout (`.jsonl.zst`) counts as the session for resume and fork, but is not
  read for a handoff.
- Handing over a conversation longer than the 36,000-character cap would need the transcript
  written to a file for the new agent to read, rather than passed inline.
