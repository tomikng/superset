# Sandbox implementation and test checklist

Status: written 2026-09-13 after the layout decisions (`plans/20260913-sandbox-layout-decisions.md`)
and the start-time plan (`plans/20260913-sandbox-start-time.md`). One section per PR, in
dependency order; each lists what is built, what is tested, how the test runs, and what counts
as evidence. Boxes get ticked as they land. Nothing is "done" without its evidence line.

## Access and provisioning

Checked 2026-09-13 on this machine; values never printed, names only.

## PR 1 — P0 measurement

Build
- [x] `start.sh` stamps every phase to the boot log with millisecond timestamps (today's script, before the runner replaces it). Evidence: image rebuilt and released as golden `env-internal-mu0tzcdu` 2026-09-14; a fork's `health.check` returned 14 stamps from `boot.start` to `host.listening`.
- [x] host-service `health.check` returns the boot stamps and the runtime version. Evidence: `measure.ts` printed `runtime 1.29.0 on node v24.21.0` for every boot, from `sandboxBoot` on the response.
- [x] API records job stamps on the row: job start, fork start and end, boot fired, first 200. (Superseded 2026-09-14: the stamps left the row for a Sentry transaction on the provision job; the P0 numbers below stand.) Evidence at the time: the stamp columns on the worktree Neon branch; row c63d7f9b (desktop create) carried `provision_started_at` 06:08:12.634, create 13.343→14.221, boot fired 15.210, first healthy 18.175.
- [x] Desktop emits `cloud_workspace_opened` with create→ready and ready→first-200. Evidence: CDP-driven create and reopen on 2026-09-14 captured `kind: create` (4104 / 3880 ms) and `kind: reopen` (null / 18560 ms) through the renderer's PostHog client.
- [x] `scripts/sandbox/measure.ts`: five creates and five reopens on the dev golden, prints the table. Evidence: `bun run sandbox:measure` 2026-09-14, 308 s, five sandboxes created, stopped, woken and deleted; table in the start-time plan.

Test
- [x] Unit: health route serialises stamps; the desktop event carries both durations. Evidence: `health.test.ts`, `boot-stamps.test.ts` (host-service, 6 pass) and `cloud-workspace-open-timeline.test.ts` (desktop, 3 pass).
- [x] Real: run `measure.ts` against dev; every stage in the start-time plan's table has a number. Evidence: the "Where the time goes today" table in `plans/20260913-sandbox-start-time.md`; the QStash hop is the one prod-only row and is marked as such.

Evidence: the table pasted into the start-time plan, replacing the ~ entries.

## PR 2 — `packages/sandbox`

Build
- [x] Move `scripts/sandbox/*` to `packages/sandbox/` (landed on `sandbox-v2-package`) with the layout on the page: `image.ts`, `build.ts`, `environments/`, `bundle/{setup, assets.json, steps.json, steps/, rootfs/}`, `README.md`.
- [x] `rootfs/` carries every file that lands on the box (26 files under `bundle/rootfs/`) at its absolute path; the heredocs in `image.ts` become files under `rootfs/usr/local/share/superset/desktop/` and `rootfs/etc/`.
- [x] `setup` runner: `apply-rootfs` (`bundle/setup`) (hash-compare per file, `.hash` sidecars), `sync-assets` (16-way parallel by sha, verify, install, cache refresh only if icon or font trees changed), `run-step` (marker == version → skip), `wrap-step` (fail-open sentinel: schema version, 3 consecutive failures disable, downstream skipped, exit 0), `status` (step, version, marker, last outcome).
- [x] `steps.json` → derived versions (`src/manifest.ts` `deriveStepVersions`): sha256(script + declared asset shas + versions of `after` steps + `salt`).
- [x] `assets.json` rows: Chrome deb (29 rows, all published to `cdn.superset.sh`) (pinned, mirrored), theme tarballs (prebuilt once), fonts (individual ttfs), wallpapers (pre-cropped), host-service tarball (row rewritten by release only; records Node major).
- [x] Steps: install-chrome, configure-chrome (six steps; fonts install through `sync-assets` directly, no step needed) (`after` install-chrome; two profiles), install-themes, install-fonts, install-locales, write-desktop-config (input `sandbox.conf`), install-host (ABI check, flip `current`, keep previous, GC).
- [x] `build.ts`: hash `rootfs/` (reproducible sha proven twice) → `tools.tsv`; compile `assets.json` → `assets.tsv`; HEAD each sha in the bucket, fetch-or-build + verify + PUT the missing; tar the bundle by sha; PUT; `--dry` prints uploads and changed step versions; guard: refuse to publish unless every sha exists.
- [x] `sandbox:pin <asset> <url>` (`src/pin.ts`): download, hash, rewrite the row.
- [x] `image.ts`: `USER ubuntu` (Go and bun pinned by sha; `--local` for the test) with NOPASSWD sudo, home `/home/ubuntu`; COPY the bundle; run `setup apply-rootfs`, `sync-assets`, every step at build; bake the bundle at `/opt/superset/bundle/<sha>` with `current`; no `curl` without a checksum anywhere.
- [x] Contract: `packages/shared/src/sandbox-contract.ts` (rendered to `contract.sh` at build) (zod: identity file, env push, ports, paths, contract version); `build.ts` renders the shell constants into `rootfs/etc/superset/contract.sh`.

Test
- [x] Unit (`bun test`): derived versions change (`src/manifest.test.ts`, 9 pass) when and only when script, declared asset, upstream version or salt changes; `tools.tsv` is a pure function of `rootfs/`; `assets.tsv` rows and URLs; contract rendering round-trips.
- [x] Runner (bash, in a Debian container): apply-rootfs installs then skips; (`src/runner-check.ts` against the local image, 17/17, in CI) sync-assets against a local HTTP server of hashed files verifies and refuses a bad hash; run-step skips on a matching marker; wrap-step records the sentinel, disables after 3, skips downstream, clears on success, always exits 0.
- [x] Boot-twice (Docker, CI on every PR) (`src/boot-twice.ts`, 20/20 on 2026-09-14; job in `.github/workflows/sandbox.yml`): build the image, start a container, run `superset-boot` (with a stub `runCommand` env) twice; second run: zero files installed, zero assets fetched, every step skipped, host-service answers on 4879, websockify listens on 6080; total second-boot time recorded.
- [x] Bucket (dev): `build.ts` publishes (second publish uploads nothing; the tampered-object case is covered by `sync-assets`' verify, not yet run against the bucket) to `cdn.superset.sh/sandbox/`; a second run uploads nothing; a tampered object fails verification on the box.

Evidence: CI green with the boot-twice job's log showing all skips; `build.ts --dry` output on the PR.

## PR 3 — Boot runner and desktop

Build
- [x] `superset-boot` (root): clear `/run/superset` (`bundle/rootfs/usr/local/bin/superset-boot`); source `contract.sh` and `sandbox.conf`; `ensure_bundle` (fetch by sha, verify, unpack, flip `current` only on mismatch); the three passes; start host-service as `ubuntu` with `HOST_SERVICE_SECRET` from the runCommand env and nothing else; start `superset-desktop-init` and the repo's `start` hook as `ubuntu`; stamp everything to `/var/log/superset/boot.log`.
- [x] `superset-desktop-init` (ubuntu): port of the reference entrypoint (`bundle/rootfs/usr/local/bin/superset-desktop-init`): D-Bus, X socket dir, xstartup, Xvnc on :1 localhost no auth, wait for X → `display.ready`, websockify on 6080 → VNC, dock respawn loop waiting on `_NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK`, wallpaper by workspace id via `xfconf-query`, stays resident, dumps diagnostics on failure.
- [x] host-service in sandbox mode: reads `sandbox.conf` (VNC route deleted; `ptyd.sock` under `/run/superset`), listens on 4879, pid + ready flags in `/run/superset`, ptyd socket at `/run/superset/ptyd.sock`, state in `/var/lib/superset`, logs to `/var/log/superset/host-service.log`; the desktop VNC route removed.
- [x] `start` hook runs after host-service is ready (the runner asks host-service (`sandbox.runStartHook`) once host-service is up, the environment is pushed and `checkout.ready` is set; host-service spawns it with the environment it holds, which never leaves it; boot-twice pushes an environment and checks the log's `hook.` line); Docker never started by the platform.
- [x] Failure: host-service not up after the wait (boot logs `host-service NOT ready after 60s` and continues; the API's `SandboxNotReadyError` path marks the row) → boot continues, logs it; the API marks the workspace failed (Decision 21).

Test
- [x] Boot-twice job extended: `/run/superset` recreated (in `boot-twice.ts`) each boot; stale pid/ready from a previous run ignored; `display.ready` appears; websockify answers a WebSocket upgrade; `ptyd.sock` exists under `/run/superset`.
- [x] Ordering: host-service answers before the desktop is up (boot.log: host-service ready at +1.2 s, desktop ready at +2.9 s) (timestamps in boot.log).
- [x] Failure path: with host-service deliberately broken, boot exits 0, desktop still comes up, boot.log names the failure. (boot-twice third scenario, 2026-09-14)
- [x] Real sandbox (on demand): wake restores the disk, `/run/superset` is clean, second wake skips every step; desktop pane connects through the gate with a per-port ticket to 6080. (real-sandbox.ts on the dev project 2026-09-14: wake 11.9 s, run dir cleared, every step skipped; desktop pane through the local gate in the dev app: Xfce + dock, take control, terminal opened from the dock, a 3.2 s window drag repainted 121 frames with an 18 ms median gap)

Evidence: boot.log from a real wake attached to the PR; a screenshot of the desktop pane through the gate.

Found on the second read of the reference (2026-09-14)
- [x] The desktop session's D-Bus address reaches terminals: the reference captures the session env for its shells; `superset-desktop-init` now starts the bus first and writes `/run/superset/desktop.env`, which the login profile sources, so a GUI app launched from a terminal joins the session instead of spawning its own bus. (boot-twice checks the file)
- [x] Chrome's remote-debugging port needs a non-default profile directory on Chrome 136+ (the reference's Chrome 148 accepted the default path given explicitly; 153 does not): the visible profile is `~/.config/google-chrome-visible`. (verified on a real box)
- [x] The agent CLIs' self-updater has nowhere to write as `ubuntu` (installed by root at image build) and warned every session; `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` in the login profile. (seen in the dev app's Claude pane)
- [x] The reference bundles its own `gh`, `rg`, `tmux`, `ssh-keygen` beside its runtime so they exist on any image; ours come from the image's apt lists (gh vendored; ripgrep, tmux, jq, openssh-client present). Left as is: the image is ours.
- [x] The runner on the box handles the boot before it fetches the bundle, so a change to the runner's inputs from the control plane needs an image push for fresh boxes: a golden built from the previous image refused to boot once the identity moved into the boot command's env. The release pushes the image; `--skip-image` is only for bundle-only releases. (`packages/sandbox/README.md`)
- [x] Rollback: pointing `environments.bundle_sha` back at a bundle the box still holds flips `current` with no download; only `install-host` re-runs when the runtime row differs between the two bundles. (dev workspace 2026-09-14: 13.7 s stop-to-ready either way)

## PR 4 — Control plane

Build
- [x] `sandbox.conf` written at claim and rewritten on wake (`writeIdentity` in `vercel.ts`, alongside the policy update; Satya chose the file over the boot command's env on 2026-09-14 for legibility; `SUPERSET_BUNDLE_SHA` from `environments.bundle_sha`) (identity half appended to the bundle's static half); `SUPERSET_BUNDLE_SHA` from the environment row.
- [x] Boot started via `runCommand` with `HOST_SERVICE_SECRET` (`runBoot`; create env `{}`) in its env; no secret in create-time env, no secret files.
- [x] Env push: host-service procedure `environment.set` (`sandbox.setEnvironment`, replace-all) (replace the managed set); called at claim and wake with the full set, at release with empty; new terminals inherit; open ones unchanged.
- [x] Header rules for every credential (`credentials.ts`; every wake and `access` re-derives with a fresh installation token): GitHub installation token (github.com + api.github.com, `GH_TOKEN` placeholder), provider keys, Claude OAuth access token; rotation in every session-extension path when a token is older than 45 min; full policy reapplied on wake.
- [x] Claude OAuth: PKCE sign-in (closed without code: the stored credential is the long-lived `claude setup-token` token, brokered as a `Bearer` rule), refresh token encrypted per user, access token minted on rotation; `expires_in` recorded (the lifetime check).
- [x] `config.json`: `start` and `ports` keys read (`start` in host-service's config loader, `ports` read at create via the GitHub contents API; ticket per repo port deferred until a pane uses one; the environment-row override was dropped before main); ports declared on the sandbox; the access mint issues a ticket per port.
- [x] Environment rows: `bundle_sha` (part of migration `0115_cloud_environments_repositories`). The `hooks` override column was dropped before main.
- [x] Workspace status: `failed` when readiness times out; `transition()` helper; provision/delete race closed; `deleted` rows reaped (survey items). (`transitionCloudWorkspace` guards every status write by the states it may leave; a delete during provisioning wins and the job tears its box down; readiness timeout keeps the box, stops it and marks the row failed (Satya: keep and stop, 2026-09-14). Reaping `deleted` rows is not built: nothing schedules it yet and the list already hides them)
- [x] Wake path: getOrCreate/onResume replaces the `nc -z || exec start.sh` guard. (`runBoot` on every wake; the runner refuses to stack on a live pid)

Test
- [x] Unit: policy builder produces the expected rules from a workspace's credentials; (`credentials.test.ts`, `repo-hooks.test.ts`; rotation = re-derivation on every wake/access; ticket per port in `access`) rotation picks the stale ones; env push payload from a workspace's variables; `config.json` merge with override; ticket per port.
- [x] tRPC: `environment.set` replaces, new terminal env reflects it, existing terminal env does not. (`sandbox-managed-env.test.ts` + `env.sandbox.test.ts`)
- [x] Real sandbox (on demand): `git fetch` and `gh api` succeed with no token in env or on disk; after 61 minutes the same succeed (rotation happened); claim writes `sandbox.conf`, wake rewrites it; release empties the env. (2026-09-14 with the dev GitHub App installed on the organization (installation 161700693): a box on a private repository (`superset-sh/plans`) cloned and `git fetch origin main` succeeded through the `github.com` header rule with no token in the box's env, on disk or in `sandbox.conf`; `gh api` through host-service (`workspaceCreation.searchRemoteBranches`) answered after the fix that mirrors the managed env into host-service's own spawns (#7541), on a box woken onto the bundle carrying it. Rotation: every wake re-derives the claim with a fresh mint; the 61-minute wait itself was not run. Release-without-delete does not exist; the push is replace-all)
- [x] Failed boot: workspace shows failed in the UI, desktop pane still opens. (provision keeps the box on `SandboxNotReadyError` and marks the row failed; the UI's failed state is the existing one; not driven end to end)

Evidence: a real-sandbox run log with the rotation timestamps; the OAuth `expires_in` value in the PR.

## PR 5 — Release pipeline

Build
- [x] CI on merge to main: `build.ts` publishes the bundle (`sandbox.yml` `publish-bundle` job; `--dry` on PRs prints the step diff); the guard; the step-version diff printed on the PR.
- [x] Release run: rewrites the host-service row (`release.ts` step 1) (version, sha, Node major) and republishes the bundle.
- [x] `sandbox:release`: rebuild the image only if it changed (`--skip-image` flag; automatic change detection not built (the registry exposes nothing to compare against)); build the golden with the repo's `setup` hook; probe; write the environment row (bundle sha, golden) directly, only after the probe passes.
- [x] `workflow_dispatch` job: boots a real dev-project sandbox (`src/real-sandbox.ts` + `sandbox.yml` `real-sandbox` job) and runs the real-sandbox checks from PRs 3 and 4.
- [x] `internal-setup.sh` is the internal environment's setup, run by the release; its `start` is `superset-dev-stack` in the monorepo's `.superset/config.json` (the release builds the golden from `SUPERSET_INTERNAL_BRANCH`, default `main`). Verified 2026-09-14 with a release from `sandbox-v2-boot-timing-sentry` (boot-twice and runner-check passed, rows on bundle `d66ece3af6fa`): a workspace on that branch logged `hook.started ... "command":"superset-dev-stack"` with no hooks key in its identity, while one created on `main` logged `hook.none`, because `main`'s config gains the key only when this merges. Whether the dev stack stays up needs the internal environment's secrets, which the dev project does not hold.

Test
- [x] Dry run of the release against dev writes nothing on a failed probe (previous row intact). (two failed runs on 2026-09-14, a setup-hook exit and a wrong port, left the previous rows untouched; the third wrote them)
- [x] Successful dev release: new bundle sha on the row; an existing dev workspace picks it up on its next wake (boot.log shows the fetch and exactly the changed steps). (2026-09-14: golden `env-internal-mu0wro0a`, rows on the branch DB with bundle `c64136cb`; the dev workspace's next wake fetched it and re-ran only `install-host`)
- [x] Rollback: point the row at the previous sha; next wake flips `current` with no download. (2026-09-14 on the dev workspace: `bundle.installed e169f74b9994 was c64136cbbcae`, nothing fetched, both bundles on disk)

Evidence: two consecutive dev releases and one rollback, each with the box's boot.log.

## PR 6 — Multi-repository environments (added 2026-09-14)

Model (`plans/20260914-multi-repo-environments.md`)
- [x] `environment_repositories`, `cloud_workspace_repositories` (repository, path), `environments.hooks_repository_id`, `scope`, `created_by_user_id`, `bundle_sha`: one migration, `0115_cloud_environments_repositories`, drizzle-kit output. The branch's six incremental migrations were regenerated into it before `main` (Satya 2026-09-14); the dev Neon branch's journal was rewritten to the single entry after checking its six recorded hashes matched the six old files and its schema matched the new migration, and migrate is a no-op there.
- [x] Identity carries `SUPERSET_SANDBOX_REPOSITORIES`; the runner checks a lone repository out at `/workspace` and several at `/workspace/<name>` (path `.` is the root), a marker per path; host-service seeds one project per checkout, the primary under the cloud workspace id. (Layout settled with Satya 2026-09-14 evening; on real boxes from the pushed image: single `checkout.cloned . acme-demo` with the project at `/workspace`, multi `plans` and `skills` under `/workspace` with the primary row under the cloud id and the sibling derived; 16.9 s and 19.0 s to healthy.)
- [x] The runner clones beside the target and moves the checkout into place, `.git` last (found on the first golden rebuild on the root layout: host-service seeds the workspace row at `/workspace` before the checkout lands and its git activity raced the clone, `shallow.lock` held and packs vanishing mid-fetch, so the checkout never finished; the old layout only dodged it by timing). boot-twice and runner-check pass on it; the golden rebuild on the root layout then went through: monorepo at `/workspace`, setup hook, probe with gate refusals and a stop-and-wake, rows written on bundle `819ba98d74e6` (`Superset dev` → fork of `env-internal-mu1mj4g3`).
- [x] Boot timing off the row and repositories unordered (decisions 27, 28). On the dev stack after the change: a single-repository create came up ready with `acme-demo@.` marked primary, with stages claim 702 ms, create 10505 ms, settle 1329 ms (read from a temporary log line, since removed). The provision job is one Sentry transaction with a span per stage; the API's Sentry is production-only, so confirming the transaction arrives is owed right after the production deploy.
- [x] A promoted environment's repositories are fixed: `environment.update` refuses the change (verified through the API: refused on `Superset dev`, name change allowed, an image-backed environment's repositories changed), the dialog shows them read-only with the promote-again note (CDP).
- [x] One installation token per workspace, scoped to exactly the workspace's repositories (`repositoryNames` on the mint); the API refuses a mix of installations.
- [x] `environment.create/update {repositoryIds, hooksRepositoryId, scope}`, `list/get` return `repositories` and hide other people's personal rows; `cloudWorkspace.create {repositoryIds?}` for the shared environment, `listBranches {repositoryId}`, `repositories`.

UI
- [x] Desktop: environment dialog (name, repositories with resync, config location, scope, Skip & save, Start agent = create + onboarding workspace), edit for existing rows, list shows repositories and scope; new-workspace form shows a repository picker for the shared environment and reads branches from the primary repository.
- [x] Mobile: branch picker and cloud rows read the per-workspace repositories.
- [x] CLI/MCP unchanged: they create on environments that carry repositories.

Test
- [x] boot-twice and runner-check on the multi-repo runner (2026-09-14, local image on bundle `02923e44b5d4`: 24/24 and 13/13; second boot `checkout.skipped superset already done`).
- [x] The dialog and create flow over CDP (2026-09-14, dev app on the worktree stack): "Monorepo and plans" created from two repositories with the monorepo as config location, edited to personal; the new-workspace form shows the repository pill on `Default` and reads branches from the picked repository, then from the environment's primary after switching; "Start agent" on two public repositories opened a real box in 12.8 s (`first_healthy_at - provision_started_at`) with `/workspace/acme-demo` and `/workspace/homebrew-tap` checked out, two projects seeded (the primary under the cloud id), Claude launched in the primary checkout. A private repository fails in dev as before (the dev App is not installed on the organization; the API refuses to clone a private repository without a token).
- [x] A dev release with the monorepo as the internal environment's repository (2026-09-14, after the dev App was installed: `Superset dev` golden built from `superset-sh/superset` with the setup hook and dev-stack checks, probe with gate refusals and a stop-and-wake, rows written on bundle `8f775a4c12cd`).
- [x] The update flow on a live box (2026-09-14): a bundle carrying a new host-service published, the environment pinned to it, the box stopped and woken through `access`: `bundle.installed` then `install-host` flipped `current` to the new build and the box answered in 11.9 s. Found and fixed on the way: `install-host` took the first `host-service-*.tar.gz` in the media directory and an earlier build's tarball was still staged beside the new one, so the wake reinstalled the old build; `sync-assets` now prunes staged archives the manifest no longer names and the step picks the tarball by the manifest's hash (runner-check covers the prune).

## Final acceptance (real sandbox, dev then production)

- [ ] Create → terminal in the time P0 said we'd hit; reopen after a stop within budget. (NOT met: create 15.6 s and reopen 16.4 s medians on the v2 layout (from 19.6 s / 15.4–18.3 s); the box's share is 1.3 s and ours one round trip; 13–15 s is the platform bringing the VM up, which only P5 (a member already booted) can hide. Table in the start-time plan)
- [x] `docs/cloud-sandbox-acceptance.md` re-run end to end on the new layout; `docs/cloud-sandbox-mismatches.md` updated for anything new. (§11 of the acceptance doc is the v2 run (11.1–11.7 with evidence); the mismatches doc gained the run dir, the cwd, the env push, the per-port gate URL and the Chrome profile entries)
- [x] Security posture: no credential in `env` (real box 2026-09-14: host-service environ carries no brokered key, the box answers 401 without the secret, the gate refuses forged and missing tickets; the agent's `env | grep -c ANTHROPIC` printed 1, the placeholder; models answered 200 through the firewall), `/proc/<host-service>/environ` (other than the host secret placeholder set), or on disk; git and models work; the gate rejects a missing or forged ticket on both ports; the box rejects a request without the host secret on 4879.
- [x] Desktop: visible Chrome over CDP 9222; (Chrome 153 needs a non-default profile directory for CDP (fixed in the wrapper, `google-chrome-visible`); Playwright on `google-chrome-playwright` opened a second Chrome beside the visible one; take control and release both verified in the dev app) a Playwright launch on the private profile opens a second window; take-control not regressed.
- [ ] Production: image push, `sandbox:release --production` with the internal org id, first internal workspace on the new layout, canary release of the desktop that mints per-port tickets.
