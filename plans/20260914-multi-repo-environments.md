# Multi-repository environments

Status: decided and built 2026-09-14 on `sandbox-v2` (branch `sandbox-v2-multi-repo`), after
Satya asked for the environment-creation flow other platforms have: several repositories per
environment, one of them named as the source of the hooks, a personal or organization scope,
and an agent that onboards the checkout. Each call below was mine; overturn any of them.

## The model

- **An environment lists its repositories, unordered.** `environment_repositories` rows. The
  primary, the checkout a workspace opens on, is the config repository (`hooks_repository_id`),
  else the first by full name. The shared `Default` environment
  lists none and takes its repositories at workspace create, so anyone can start from the
  base image with any connected repository.
- **A workspace fixes its checkouts at create.** `cloud_workspace_repositories`: repository and
  path. No branch is stored: the primary checks out the workspace's own branch
  (`cloud_workspaces.branch`, set from the create form) and the rest their default branch, read
  from the repository catalog when the box is claimed; after the first checkout the live branch
  is whatever git says. The environment's repositories if it has any, else the ones picked in the
  form. The primary gets the chosen branch; the rest their default branch. The box's
  checkouts, the firewall rule and the desktop's rows all follow from this and never drift.
- **One installation per workspace.** The firewall carries one header rule per host, so
  `github.com` gets one token, and an installation token spans repositories only within its
  installation (`repositoryNames` on the mint). The API refuses an environment or workspace
  that mixes installations.
- **The hooks repository.** `environments.hooks_repository_id` names which checkout's
  `.superset/config.json` the box acts on (the "config location" in the form). The API reads that
  repository's config at create for `ports`; the box runs its `start` hook there. There is no
  per-environment hook override: the internal environment's `start` is the monorepo's own
  cloud-only `start` key, and its `setup` is run by the release.
- **Scope.** `environments.scope` is `organization` or `personal`; a personal environment is
  listed and usable by its creator alone (`created_by_user_id`). Promote copies the source
  environment's scope, hooks and repositories onto the golden's row.

## The box

- A lone repository is the workspace root, `/workspace`, as the reference machine had it;
  several sit under it at `/workspace/<name>` (the owner disambiguates a clash). The path is
  data on the workspace row (`.` for the root), so the runner, the seeding and the hooks read
  it rather than count. Decided with Satya 2026-09-14 over "always `/workspace/<name>`".
- **A promoted environment's repositories are fixed.** Its golden was cloned, set up and
  snapshotted for that set; a repository added later would be a bare clone with no setup, one
  removed would stay baked into every fork, and under the root layout a sibling would land
  inside the first checkout. `environment.update` refuses the change; the dialog shows the
  set read-only with "promote again to change". Image-backed environments (the shared
  `Default`, anything not yet promoted) change freely: every workspace on them clones fresh.
- The identity carries `SUPERSET_SANDBOX_REPOSITORIES` (JSON: url, branch, path, hooks flag)
  instead of one URL and branch. The boot runner checks each out, a marker per path under
  `/var/lib/superset/checkouts/`, and `checkout.ready` once all are in; a golden has the
  markers stripped so a fork fetches its branch into the checkouts it inherited.
- host-service seeds one project and one workspace row per repository. The primary's row
  carries the cloud workspace's id (the app opens on it, every fan-out keys on it); the others
  get ids derived from the workspace id and the path, so a restart seeds the same rows. The
  desktop shows them under the cloud workspace.
- The `start` hook runs in the hooks repository's checkout; the internal environment's dev
  stack scripts take their checkout as the cwd they are started in.

## The API

- `environment.create { name, repositoryIds[], hooksRepositoryId?, scope }`, `update` accepts
  the same; `list` and `get` return `repositories` and hide other people's personal rows.
- `cloudWorkspace.create` takes `repositoryIds[]` only for an environment without its own;
  `listBranches` takes a `repositoryId`; `repositories` lists every workspace's checkouts for
  the sidebar. The `repo` procedure and the hardcoded repository are gone.
- The release writes the internal environment's repository (the monorepo) and names it the
  hooks repository.

## The flow

The environment dialog: name, repositories (multi-select from the organization's GitHub
installation, with a refresh that resyncs it), config location (none or one of the chosen
repositories), scope, then "Skip and save" or "Start agent". "Start agent" saves the
environment and creates a cloud workspace on it with the onboarding prompt
(`ENVIRONMENT_ONBOARDING_PROMPT`): the agent installs what the project needs, writes
`.superset/config.json` hooks, and lists the secrets it lacks; the person watches in the
terminal and desktop, and promotes the result to a golden from the sidebar when it runs.

The new-workspace form: for an environment with repositories the pill names them; for one
without, a repository picker appears beside it. The base-branch pill, which the cloud form
used to hide, reads the primary repository's branches and its choice is the branch the box
checks out (mobile already sent one).

## Verified

2026-09-14 on the worktree dev stack: dialog create and edit over CDP; the form's repository
and branch pills on both kinds of environment; a real "Start agent" create on two public
repositories (box healthy 12.8 s after provisioning started, both checkouts under
`/workspace`, two projects seeded, the agent in the primary). boot-twice and runner-check on
the multi-repo runner. Records: the implementation checklist, PR 6.

## Decided 2026-09-14 late, with Satya

- **No `position`.** Repositories read alphabetically everywhere; the workspace opens on the
  environment's config location (`hooks_repository_id`), else the first repository by name.
  Two columns and one concept fewer.
- **Boot timing leaves the row.** No stamp columns; the desktop's `cloud_workspace_opened` event
  and its terminal attach notifier are removed. The provision job is one Sentry transaction with
  a span per stage (claim, create, settle), sampled by name so nothing else in the API is traced.
  Whether it arrives is checked after the production deploy; no fallback is kept.
- **One migration.** The branch's six incremental migrations were regenerated into
  `0115_cloud_environments_repositories` before `main`.

## TODO: `.superset/config.json` for cloud

The file grew `start` and `ports` beside the local `setup`, `teardown` and `run` as flat keys.
It wants a redesign that makes the cloud part explicit (Satya 2026-09-14): which keys run where,
how an environment's setup is declared, and how several repositories' configs combine.

## TODO: multi-repository as a product

Today a multi-repository workspace opens on one checkout (the config location). What it should
do, and is not built yet:

- Terminals and the agent open at `/workspace`, so an agent sees every checkout.
- The sidebar offers a repository picker under a multi-repository workspace, and the git
  panels (changes, branch, pull request) follow the picked repository; the cloud workspace
  row itself points at the root, which is not a git checkout.
- One sibling workspace row per repository already exists on the box for that purpose.

## Not built

- A branch per non-primary repository at create (they take their default branch).
- Repositories from more than one GitHub installation in one workspace.
- A pane that opens a repository `port` through the gate; the ports are published, the mint
  still issues tickets for the platform's two.
