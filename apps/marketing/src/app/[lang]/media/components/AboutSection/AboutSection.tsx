					Superset (YC S26) is the open-source IDE for the AI agents era, where
					engineers run hundreds of coding agents like Claude Code and Codex in
					parallel. In under a year, more than 130,000 developers across 176
					countries have run Superset and created over 1.5 million agent
					workspaces. Japan is its second-largest market after the US, with over
					12,000 developers adopting it before it was even available in
					Japanese, and Asia as a whole now accounts for more users than the US.
					Superset is used by engineers at Netflix, Microsoft, NVIDIA, DoorDash,
					Wix, and Mistral AI globally, and across Asia at ByteDance, Toss,
					Kakao, Grab, LINE, and Rakuten. It has 14k+ GitHub stars, hit #1 on
					Product Hunt, and recently launched full Japanese language support.
