 * Gets composer attachments into the workspace's worktree and returns their

 * attachment reaches the agent.
 *
 * The bytes go device → cloud storage → host, never through the relay: a
 * relay request body is buffered whole in a Cloudflare Worker and refused
 * above 100 MB by its edge, which is what made a large attachment fail with
 * an unparseable response rather than an error anyone could read.
 *
 * By here the upload is usually finished — it started when the file was
 * attached — so this waits only on what the message outpaced.
