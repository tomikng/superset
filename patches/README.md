# Patched dependencies

Applied by bun at install time via `patchedDependencies` in the root
`package.json`. **Keys are pinned to exact versions** — bumping a patched
package makes its patch stop matching, and the fix silently disappears while
everything still builds. Every patch listed here must have a CI guard test
that fails when its markers vanish from the installed package.

## metro (`metro@<version>.patch`)

**Why:** `apps/mobile` runs worklets Bundle Mode (`react-native-streamdown`, see
`apps/mobile/babel.config.js`). Its Babel plugin writes each worklet to
`node_modules/react-native-worklets/.worklets/<hash>.js` *during* the transform
pass — after Metro has crawled the filesystem — so a one-shot bundle can't hash
files that didn't exist at crawl time and dies with `Failed to get the SHA-1`.
The dev server survives on re-crawls; `expo export` and every EAS build fail
100% of the time from a clean install, which is what errored the first two
production builds (2026-08-13). Upgrading worklets does not fix it — 0.11.4
fails identically.

**What it changes** (`src/node-haste/DependencyGraph.js`): `getOrComputeSha1`
returns a synthetic hash for any path under `react-native-worklets/.worklets`
instead of consulting the file map. Taken verbatim from upstream —
[`bundleMode/patches/patch-package/metro`](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/tree/main/packages/react-native-worklets/bundleMode/patches)
— and documented as the recommended fix in the [Bundle Mode setup
guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-worklets/docs/bundleMode/setup/).
Temporary until the change lands in Metro.

**Guard test:** `apps/mobile/metro-worklets-patch.test.ts`.

**Regenerating after a version bump** (~5 min): upstream keeps one patch per
Metro version. Find yours with `bun why metro --top`, then:

```bash
bun patch metro
curl -L "https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/raw/main/packages/react-native-worklets/bundleMode/patches/patch-package/metro/metro%2B<version>.patch" | git apply
bun patch --commit 'node_modules/metro'
bun test apps/mobile/metro-worklets-patch.test.ts
```

If upstream has no patch for the new Metro yet, the previous version's patch
usually still applies — the touched function is stable. Verify with a cold
bundle: delete `node_modules/react-native-worklets/.worklets/*.js`, then
`npx expo export --platform ios --clear` from `apps/mobile`.

Worklets also publishes a `metro-runtime` patch that extends Fast Refresh to
worklet runtimes. Not applied here — it's dev-only ergonomics, not a build fix.

## @xterm/addon-webgl (`@xterm%2Faddon-webgl@<version>.patch`)

**Why:** SUPER-1793 / PR #6352. Truecolor-heavy TUI output (e.g. Claude Code's
animated shimmer) mints a new glyph-atlas entry per distinct RGB color. The
addon's intended `FORCED_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE = 4096` clamp is dead code, so atlas
pages merge-double toward `gl.MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE` (16384² = 1 GiB of RGBA per
page) and orphaned page canvases only free on lazy GC. Measured: GPU process
grew to ~11 GB in 90 s; with the patch it plateaus at ~2 GB (video evidence on
the PR).

**What it changes** (in `lib/addon-webgl.js`, `lib/addon-webgl.mjs`, and the
matching `src/` files for readability — bundles are what run):

1. `GlyphRenderer`: `TextureAtlas.maxTextureSize = Math.min(4096, gl.MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE)`.
2. `WebglRenderer`: same clamp on `_deviceMaxTextureSize` (feeds the
   oversized-glyph overflow page allocation in `TextureAtlas`).
3. `TextureAtlas`: zero `canvas.width/height` for merged-away and evicted
   pages so backing stores free immediately instead of waiting for GC.

An app-side safety net lives in
`apps/desktop/src/renderer/lib/terminal/terminal-addons.ts` (atlas reset after
32 page-add events) and works without the patch, but the patch is what keeps
worst-case pages at 64 MiB instead of 1 GiB.

**Guard test:**
`apps/desktop/src/webgl-atlas-patch.test.ts` asserts the
patch markers in the installed bundles. If it fails after a version bump,
regenerate the patch — don't delete the test.

**Regenerating after a version bump** (~10 min):

```bash
bun patch @xterm/addon-webgl@<new-version>
# edit node_modules/@xterm/addon-webgl per the three changes above:
#   - both lib bundles are minified; find `getParameter(<gl>.MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE)`
#     (2 sites) and wrap each in Math.min(4096, ...)
#   - find `_onRemoveTextureAtlasCanvas.fire(<p>.canvas)` (merge path) and the
#     `_evictAllPages` loop; add `<p>.canvas.width=0,<p>.canvas.height=0`
#   - mirror the edits in src/GlyphRenderer.ts, src/WebglRenderer.ts,
#     src/TextureAtlas.ts
bun patch --commit 'node_modules/@xterm/addon-webgl'
bun test apps/desktop/src/webgl-atlas-patch.test.ts
```

Before regenerating, check whether the new version made the patch obsolete:
upstream already absorbed the render-loop page-count clamp and `_evictAllPages`
from the SUPER-1793 report into 0.20.0-beta.297, and hunks 1–3 are candidates
for upstreaming. If upstream ships them, delete the patch, the
`patchedDependencies` entry, and update (not delete) the guard test.

## node-pty (`node-pty@<version>.patch`)

**Why:** DESKTOP-101 / DESKTOP-107 / DESKTOP-10J. The desktop main process
initialises the Sentry Electron SDK, whose `SentryMinidump` integration starts
Electron's `crashReporter`. On macOS that points the *task* Mach exception port
at Crashpad's handler, and macOS inherits task exception ports across
fork/exec — including into grandchildren. Superset is terminal-centric, so every
shell, coding agent, compiler and test runner a user starts is a descendant of
the app and reports its crashes to our handler, which writes a minidump into our
Crashpad database. The SDK then uploads it under our DSN as a fatal Superset
crash. Measured over seven days: 4960 of 5141 minidump events (96.5%) came from
processes that are not ours, ~700/day, each carrying an unrelated program's
memory, file paths and command line.

**What it changes** (`src/unix/spawn-helper.cc`): node-pty `posix_spawn`s a
small `spawn-helper` executable which sets up the controlling terminal and then
`execvp`s the real command — the one point that is inside the pty child and
before the user's program. The patch clears the inherited task exception ports
there. The masks are named explicitly rather than using `EXC_MASK_ALL`, which
deliberately excludes `EXC_MASK_CRASH` and would therefore compile, run, and
silently do nothing. Clearing to `MACH_PORT_NULL` does not cost the user their
own crash logs — macOS still writes its usual report to
`~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`.

The boundary is process ancestry, not a tag or heuristic: only processes
launched *into a pty* are detached. Electron's own main, renderer, GPU and
utility processes, and the node children the app spawns with
`child_process.spawn` (host-service, pty daemon — the renderer/node OOM family
this was measured against), are not spawned through node-pty and keep reporting
exactly as before. The known, accepted gap is that a Superset binary a user runs
*themselves* in a terminal (e.g. the bundled `superset` CLI) is on the detached
side.

`spawn-helper` is compiled from this source by the node-gyp rebuild that
`bun run install:deps` and electron-builder's `npmRebuild` perform, and
node-pty's loader prefers `build/Release` over the bundled `prebuilds/`, so the
patched helper is the one that ships.

**Guard test:** `apps/desktop/src/pty-crash-ports-patch.test.ts`.

**Regenerating after a version bump** (~5 min):

```bash
bun patch node-pty@<new-version>
# in node_modules/node-pty/src/unix/spawn-helper.cc, before execvp():
#   task_set_exception_ports(mach_task_self(),
#                            EXC_MASK_CRASH | EXC_MASK_RESOURCE | EXC_MASK_GUARD,
#                            MACH_PORT_NULL, EXCEPTION_DEFAULT, THREAD_STATE_NONE);
#   guarded by #if defined(__APPLE__), with #include <mach/mach.h>
bun patch --commit 'node_modules/node-pty'
bun test apps/desktop/src/pty-crash-ports-patch.test.ts
```

**Removing:** upstream could do this properly for every embedder by setting the
ports on the spawn attributes it already builds in `pty_posix_spawn`
(`posix_spawnattr_setexceptionports_np`). If node-pty ships that, drop the patch
and the `patchedDependencies` entry.

## expo-modules-jsi (`expo-modules-jsi@<version>.patch`)

**Why:** Xcode 26.2 ships Swift 6.2.3, whose C++ importer rejects
`SWIFT_RETURNS_RETAINED` on the constructors of a `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE`
class ("cannot be annotated ... because it is not returning a
SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE type"). `apple/Sources/ExpoModulesJSI-Cxx/include/RuntimeScheduler.h`
annotates both `RuntimeScheduler` constructors that way, so every local iOS
build on that toolchain fails in ExpoModulesJSI. 57.0.6 has the same header.

**What it changes:** drops the annotation from the two constructors. Swift
already treats a shared-reference constructor as returning +1, so ownership is
unchanged; the annotation was redundant on older toolchains and an error now.

**Guard test:** `apps/mobile/expo-modules-jsi-xcode26-patch.test.ts`.

**Regenerating after a version bump** (~2 min):

```bash
bun patch expo-modules-jsi
sed -i '' 's/  SWIFT_RETURNS_RETAINED RuntimeScheduler(/  RuntimeScheduler(/' \
  node_modules/expo-modules-jsi/apple/Sources/ExpoModulesJSI-Cxx/include/RuntimeScheduler.h
bun patch --commit 'node_modules/expo-modules-jsi'
bun test apps/mobile/expo-modules-jsi-xcode26-patch.test.ts
```

Check first whether upstream removed the annotations; if so delete the patch
and the `patchedDependencies` entry, and update (not delete) the guard test.
